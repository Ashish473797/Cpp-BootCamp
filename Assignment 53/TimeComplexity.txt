1. What is the time, and space complexity of the following code:
int a = 0, b = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
a = a + rand();
}
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
b = b + rand();
}
Solution:
O(n+m)


2. What is the time complexity of the following code:
int a = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
for (j = N; j > i; j--) {
a = a + i + j;
}
}
Solution:
O(n^2)


3. What is the time complexity of the following code:
int i, j, k = 0;
for (i = n / 2; i <= n; i++) {
for (j = 2; j <= n; j = j * 2) {
k = k + n / 2;
}
}
Solution:
O(n log n)


4. What is the time complexity of the following code :
void fun(int n)
{
for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++)
for (int j = 1; j + n / 2 <= n; j++)
for (int k = 1; k <= n; k = k * 2)
cout << "Prateek Jain";
}
Solution:
O(n^2 * log n)


(problem 5 to 10 each of the following recurrences, give an expression for the
runtime T (n) if the recurrence can be solved with the Master Theorem. )
5. T (n) = 3T (n/3) + n/2
